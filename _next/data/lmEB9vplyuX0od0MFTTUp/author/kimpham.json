Being aware of any changes to the network status serves as a highly beneficial monitor for UI/UX purposes and provides the best user experience possible. When crafting highly powerful web applications, we may need to detect a user's network status for many reasons, such as to determine when to use cached data or to simply display a message/new screen to the user. </p><h3 id=\"challenges-in-detecting-network-status\">Challenges in detecting network status</h3><p><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigator/onLine\">N<a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigator/onLine\">avigator.onLine</a></a> can serve as a useful tool in determining a user's online status, but it is <strong>not a reliable source of truth if used alone</strong>, especially if a user is connected to a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network\">VPN</a>.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><blockquote>\n<p>&quot;In Chrome and Safari, if the browser is not able to connect to a local area network (LAN) or a router, it is offline; all other conditions return true. So while you can assume that the browser is offline when it returns a false value, you cannot assume that a true value necessarily means that the browser can access the internet. You could be getting false positives, such as in cases where the computer is running a virtualization software that has virtual ethernet adapters that are always &quot;connected.&quot; Therefore, if you really want to determine the online status of the browser, you should develop additional means for checking.&quot; -MDN Webdocs</p>\n</blockquote>\n<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>Not only is navigator.onLine unreliable as a standalone tool, but it is also <strong>only a one-time check</strong>. One could use <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/setTimeout\">setTimeout()</a> to accomplish multiple/periodic checks, but VeloMax recommends using the popular <a href=\"https://rxjs.dev/guide/overview\">RxJS</a> library to better \"listen\" to network statuses.</p><p>Furthermore, to more accurately identify when a user is online or offline, it is suggested to use both the <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/offline_event\">window offline</a> and <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/online_event\">window online</a> events in conjunction with <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigator/onLine\">navigator.onLine</a>.

If the user is shopping online, they may use a <strong>preset filter</strong> for the <em>color</em> of the product, or simply type \"pink\" in the search bar as their query. But what happens if the customer misspells the word? Fuzzy search algorithms match queries based on a \"<a href=\"https://fusejs.io/concepts/scoring-theory.html\">fuzziness score</a>\" that the user inputs vs the pool of possible results. </p><p>In this example, let's imagine that the customer has typed \"punk\" (with the letter \"u\" instead of \"i\"). If the search feature has implemented <strong>fuzzy searching</strong>, the results will return with products that are <em>related</em> to the term \"punk\", and will also include products related to the term \"pink.\" It can also return even the lesser related words of \"punt\" or \"pint\". Without fuzzy search implemented, the search results may yield products that <strong>only </strong>relate to \"punk\", as it is only looking for precise matches.

The second parameter takes a condition that will be used to separate the values that pass said condition vs the values that fail the condition. In turn, two streams are returned and can be used for much cleaner mitigations and better code readability.</p><h3 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h3><p>There are many ways to separate and handle the logic of Observables' emitted values, such as pipe operators and if-else statements in the .subscribe() block.

Remember to ensure it is enabled in your Google Cloud account as well.</p><h3 id=\"tips-for-retrieving-the-full-name-of-a-business\">Tips for retrieving the full name of a business</h3><p>When retrieving basic information of a place via their address, utilize Places Service for its<strong> <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/reference/places-service#PlacesService.findPlaceFromQuery\">findPlaceFromQuery</a>()</strong> function. This function takes 2 parameters: a request (<code><a href=\"https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/reference/places-service#FindPlaceFromQueryRequest\">FindPlaceFromQueryRequest</a></code>), and a callback function. However, if you specify the street address (i.e. \"1313 Disneyland Dr, Anaheim, CA 92802\"), you may receive the <em>name</em> field as \"1313 Disneyland Dr\" instead of the full name of the business (\"Disneyland Park\"). </p><p>To fix this, you must include a part of the full name in your request (and the exact address does not have to be used either!) In this case, the address used in the request would be \"Disneyland, Anaheim, CA\" or even \"Disneyland 92802\", which would return with the desired business name \"Disneyland Park\". </p><h3 id=\"tips-for-retrieving-details-about-a-place\">Tips for retrieving details about a place</h3><p>When retrieving detailed information of a place, you can either use Places Service's <strong>findPlaceFromQuery()</strong> or <strong>getDetails()</strong> functions. To receive details, the <strong>findPlaceFromQuery()</strong> function requires an <em>address </em>and explicit specification of <code>['ALL']</code> as the <em>fields</em> value to get the available subset of the details from <strong>findPlaceFromQuery()</strong>. In contrast, <strong>getDetails()</strong> requires a <em>Place ID </em>and defaults the <em>fields</em> value to<code>['ALL']</code> if nothing is passed in. In addition, the <strong>getDetails()</strong> function will provide additional detailed values that are specific to <strong>only</strong> the <strong>getDetails()</strong> function (see <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/reference/places-service#PlaceResult\">PlaceResult interface</a>). </p><p>If you need <strong>getDetails()</strong> for more detailed information than what <strong>findPlaceFromQuery()</strong> provides, you will first need to get the Place ID of your desired place first, i.e. via <strong>Geocoder.geocode()</strong>, <strong>PlacesService.findPlaceFromPhoneNumber()</strong>, or <strong>PlacesService.findPlaceFromQuery()</strong>. Once you have the Place ID, you may pass it into the <strong>getDetails()</strong> function and retrieve your detailed data.</p><h3 id=\"final-things-to-remember\">Final things to remember</h3><p>Getting details of a place through Google Maps API is very feasible, but if you run into issues, it is possible that you need to change the format of your address inside the request sent. </p><p>You may not need to specify the exact address. Instead, include a small portion of the business name in the request. Moreover, if you need more details of a place than what you currently receive, you'll need to go through the two-step process of obtaining the Place ID of your place and using it in Place Service's <strong>getDetails()</strong> function. </p><p>Lastly<em> â€“ don't forget to include the Places library and enable the services in your Google Cloud account.</em></p><p>We hope this article helps you navigate the Google Maps Places services.
