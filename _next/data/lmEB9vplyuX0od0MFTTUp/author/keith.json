Â </li><li>Perform enhancements to add data during the transformation process.</li></ul><h3 id=\"using-a-mapping-profile\">Using a mapping profile</h3><p>AutoMapper allows the transformation logic to be decoupled from the classes and services that use AutoMapper by establishing <strong>mapping profiles </strong>to <em>command</em> and specify the source and destination data types.<strong> </strong></p><pre><code class=\"language-JavaScript\">const result = this.mapper.map(order, Order, OrderDto);</code></pre><p>A mapping profile is made up of a few parts. The <em>createMap</em> command defines the source, destination, and options for the mapping. </p><p>The<strong> </strong>mapping profile <em>rules</em> how individual properties on the target (destination) are created. These rules take several forms. The can be explicit (<strong>example below</strong>) or they can be generated using the @AutoMap decorator. </p><p><em>Conditional logic</em> can also be used to control the mappings. </p><pre><code class=\"language-JavaScript\">mapProfile(): MappingProfile {\n  return (mapper: Mapper) =&gt; {\n    mapper\n      .createMap(OrderDto, Order, {})\n      .forMember(\n        (dest) =&gt; dest.paid,\n        mapFrom((src) =&gt; { \n          if (src.status == 'paid') return true;\n          return false;\n        })\n      )\n      //...\n  }\n}</code></pre><h3 id=\"getting-started\">Getting started</h3><p>Getting AutoMapper up and running with NestJS is fairly easy. </p><p><strong>Step one,</strong> install the following packages from NPM, Yarn, or your package manager of choice.</p><pre><code class=\"language-bash\">npm install @automapper/{core, classes, nestjs} class-transformer class-validator\nnpm install --save-dev @automapper/types</code></pre><p><strong>Step two, </strong>add the AutoMapper module to your application using some initial setup parameters.</p><pre><code class=\"language-JavaScript\">import { classes } from '@automapper/classes';\nimport { AutomapperModule } from '@automapper/nestjs';\nimport { Module } from '@nestjs/common';\nimport { AppController } from './app.controller';\nimport { AppService } from './app.service';\n\n@Module({\n  imports: [\n    AutomapperModule.forRoot({\n      options: [{ name: 'classes', pluginInitializer: classes }],\n      singular: true,\n    }),\n    TacoModule,\n  ],\n  controllers: [AppController],\n  providers: [AppService],\n})\nexport class AppModule {}</code></pre><p>Once the setup is complete, adding Automapper to other modules is simple. </p><p><strong>Next,</strong> import the Automapper module (with-out configuration) and then add any profiles to the list of providers. If they are to be used externally, add them to the exports as well.</p><pre><code class=\"language-JavaScript\">import { AutomapperModule } from '@automapper/nestjs';\nimport { Module } from '@nestjs/common';\nimport { TacoService } from '.';\nimport { TacoProfile } from './profile';\n\n@Module({\n  imports: [AutomapperModule],\n  providers: [TacoService, TacoProfile],\n})\nexport class TacoModule {}\n\n</code></pre><h3 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h3><p>With your Automapper configured and some simple profiles setup, you'll be able to map objects from DTO to the business object with ease.

It takes much of its inspiration from <a href=\"https://angular.io/\">Angular</a>. One of the most loved (and occasionally hated) features of Angular is its Dependency Injection (DI) framework. The NestJS team has done a nice job of bringing this DI framework to the server side. Being server side there are some notable <a href=\"https://docs.nestjs.com/modules#global-modules\">differences</a>, but all things considered, it's a refreshing change.</p><p>I ran into a familiar issue while building a new module, but was a bit baffled by the solution. First, frequently, I like to use <code>index.ts</code> files to simplify imports when multiple classes from the same folder need to be imported. Simple.</p><pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">// index.ts\n\nexport * from './auth.controller';\nexport * from './auth.service';\nexport * from './constants';\nexport * from './jwt.strategy'\nexport * from './jwt-auth.guard';\nexport * from './local.strategy';\nexport * from './local-auth.guard';</code></pre><p>Anyway, I had completed authoring my <a href=\"https://docs.nestjs.com/modules\">module</a> and was about to start testing/debugging when I encountered a familiar error. The DI framework was unable to resolve on the dependencies (AuthService) in the AuthContoller.<br></p><pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">// auth.contoller.ts\n\nimport { Controller, UseGuards, Req, Body } from '@nestjs/common';\nimport { AuthService, LocalAuthGuard, JwtAuthGuard } from '.';\nimport { Request } from 'express';\nimport { AuthGuard } from '@nestjs/passport';\n\n@Controller('auth')\nexport class AuthController {\n\n    constructor(\n    private readonly authService: AuthService\n    ) {}\n    ...\n}</code></pre><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p><em>Error</em></p>\n<pre><code>Nest can't resolve dependencies of the AuthController (?). Please make sure that the argument dependency at index [0] is available in the AuthModule context.\n\nPotential solutions:\n- If dependency is a provider, is it part of the current AuthModule?\n- If dependency is exported from a separate @Module, is that module imported within AuthModule?\n  @Module({\n    imports: [ /* the Module containing dependency */ ]\n  })\n</code></pre>\n<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>Normally this would be resolved by simply importing the module that contained AuthService and ensuring AuthService is a provider and exported in the module. However, in this particular case AuthService was part of the AuthModule and had already been added to the providers and exports. </p><pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">// auth.module.ts\n\nimport { Module } from '@nestjs/common';\nimport { UserModule } from '../user/user.module';\nimport { PassportModule } from '@nestjs/passport';\nimport { JwtModule } from '@nestjs/jwt';\nimport { jwtConstants, LocalStrategy, JwtStrategy, AuthController, AuthService } from '.';\nimport { LoggerModule } from '~/shared/services/log';\n\n@Module({\n    imports: [\n        LoggerModule.forRoot(),\n        UserModule,\n        PassportModule.register({ defaultStrategy: 'local' }),\n        JwtModule.register({\n            secret: jwtConstants.secret,\n            signOptions: { expiresIn: '60s' },\n        }),\n    ],\n    providers: [\n        AuthService,\n        LocalStrategy,\n        JwtStrategy,\n    ],\n    exports: [\n        AuthService,\n        PassportModule,\n    ],\n    controllers: [AuthController],\n})\nexport class AuthModule {}</code></pre><p>The solution ended up being something I've encountered before but had long forgotten. Sometimes in DI, order seems to matter. Its not always in the place you might expect. Ultimately the solution was to re-order the <code>index.ts</code> file to move the controller to the bottom of the list.</p><pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">// index.ts\n\nexport * from './constants';\nexport * from './jwt.strategy'\nexport * from './jwt-auth.guard';\nexport * from './local.strategy';\nexport * from './local-auth.guard';\nexport * from './auth.service';\nexport * from './auth.controller'; // this went from the top to the botttom</code></pre><p>The theory here goes like this, the files that don't depend on other files within the same module go on top, next try to order as dependancies occur. This means it is probably easiest to build from the bottom up. Since the module will most likely import everything else it goes at the bottom. If there is a controller its probably next since it will likely import services, next would generally be services, things the services depend on and so on.</p><p>My understanding of this is that when you import from a <code>index.ts</code> file its not just an index (aka pointer) but it actually imports the contents of file being referenced like an include, therefore the code within the files is actually being evaluated in that order.</p><p>After making this change to the order, the application started right up. </p><p><strong>If you like our content and want more tutorials, sign up for our monthly newsletter below.

DRM?!","slug":"restricted-use-drm","html":"<p>At <strong>Kscope</strong> recently we heard that <strong>EPMA</strong> will not be available in <strong>Oracle EPM 11.2</strong>, and that it will be replaced by \"<strong>Restricted use DRM</strong>\". </p><blockquote>See our latest blog post: <a href=\"https://tevpro.com/blog/life-without-epma-what-are-my-options-with-oracle-epm-11-2/\">Life without EPMA - What are my options with Oracle EPM 11.2?</a></blockquote><p>One option to keep the functionality you've counted on with EPMA is to utilize DRM on a free, but <em>restricted</em>, use basis*.</p><h2 id=\"so-what-is-restricted-use-drm-you-say\">So what is 'restricted use' DRM, you say? </h2><p>The fully licensed version of Oracle DRM is a deeply configurable hierarchy management tool. In addition to having parents and/or child nodes, each node in DRM can be configured to store additional information in properties (attributes). The properties can be defined, inherited or derived from other information. It is a truly a general purpose metadata management tool capable of providing structure to all types of systems (ERP, Data Warehouses, etc.) Â </p><p>Sounds like a neat product right? It is, but let's see what <strong>restrictions</strong> they have placed on it for use with the EPM product suite. </p><ul><li>Much like Oracle Data Integrator (ODI), it <strong>can ONLY be used to <em>maintain</em></strong> Oracle EPM applications. </li><li>NO syncing data from cloud instances. It's only being licensed for use with <strong>on-premise</strong> applications, meaning if you have any cloud applications you would either have to manage them with something else like EDM or purchase a full use license. </li><li>Does NOT include<strong><strong> </strong></strong>functionality around Data Relationship Governance and process control management</li><li>There is a limit of <strong>five (5)</strong> stewards of master data, so it looks like other users can have visibility into DRM but only 5 people will be able to manipulate the hierarchies and node properties. It also seems to suggest that the hierarchies maintained in DRM would have to be done so <u>without integration or automation</u> (ODI). </li></ul><p>Naturally all these restrictions are removed for customers who either already own DRM or wish to purchase <strong>\"Full Use\"</strong> DRM. Be aware that unless something has changed on the licensing front, DRM is licensed on a per-node basis. So if you have a large number of members in your application this can be fairly costly. One of the slides at Kscope seemed to suggest that using DRM for <u>mapping</u> maintenance (FDMEE) may not be part of the restricted use license.</p><p>Lastly, Oracle is promising to include a whitepaper and scripts to <u>assist</u><em> </em>in the migration from EPMA to DRM, although it will probably take some knowledge of Â SQL and the DRM migration client. </p><blockquote>Remember, all on-premise Oracle EPM versions prior to 11.2 will reach end-of-life in December 2021. Once you upgrade to 11.2 all prior versions of EMPA will no longer be available. Now is the time to plan on how you will handle this transition.</blockquote><p>Transitions can be hard, but the certified Oracle consultants at VeloMax collectively have over 50+ years implementing EPM technologies.

Essbase","slug":"kscope-2019-preview-essbase","html":"<p>With <strong><a href=\"https://kscope19.odtug.com/\">Kscope19</a></strong> rapidly approaching it's hard not to notice the Essbase track. Essbase has quite a large number of available sessions and it makes sense. Essbase has expanded into new products the last couple of years and is a critical component in the cloud. In this article, we hope to help you better understand the target audience and decide on the sessions you want to hit.</p><h2 id=\"monday\"><strong>Monday</strong></h2><p>11:00 AM - 11:30 AM<br>It begins with two potentially very interesting sessions; first <a href=\"https://kscope19.odtug.com/e/in/eid=32&amp;s=2943&amp;req=info\"><strong><strong>BSO Solve Order: A Funeral for the Two Pass Calculation</strong></strong></a> makes a bold promise but one that many that have used ASO know is possible. Solve order is relatively new to BSO but has been around for a while in ASO. We think this is going to be the better option for most Essbase professionals, who couldn't use a refresher on the in's and out's of solve order. That said, if your well versed in solve order and interested in the REST API and how it can be used to update your Essbase cube, you might want to take a look at <strong><strong><a href=\"https://kscope19.odtug.com/e/in/eid=32&amp;s=2885&amp;print=1&amp;req=info\">Building a New EAS? APEX Meets OAC</a></strong></strong>. In this session the presenter is promising to build an administration utility based on the REST API using APEX. In theory this is a neat idea and could be potentially useful even if your company doesn't license APEX.</p><p>11:45 AM - 12:45 PM<br>Next, you have a session that focuses on Optimization, Security and \"Enterprise\" Essbase. In <a href=\"https://kscope19.odtug.com/e/in/eid=32&amp;s=2626&amp;req=info\"><strong>Seven Weird Tricks for Essbase Optimization Which Really Work!!!</strong></a> <a href=\"http://looksmarter.blogspot.com/\">Edward Roske</a> (one of the people who literally wrote the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Edward-Roske/e/B00J237CUW\">book(s)</a> on Essbase) promises to help you tune Essbase. In <a href=\"https://kscope19.odtug.com/e/in/eid=32&amp;s=2692&amp;print=1&amp;req=info\"><strong>OAC Security Standard Practice</strong></a><strong> </strong><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/kavibharathi-munusamy-21b88a52\">Kavi</a> is going to discuss how to setup single sign on (SSO), locking down OAC as well integrating with identity tools. Last in <a href=\"https://kscope19.odtug.com/e/in/eid=32&amp;s=2678&amp;print=1&amp;req=info\"><strong><strong>A Journey Across the Kroger Enterprise Essbase Environment from the Grocery Store to the C-Suite Executive</strong></strong></a> the fine folks from Kroger will discuss how in addition to Essbase and the other Oracle EPM tools that <a href=\"https://www.appliedolap.com/products/dodeca-spreadsheet-management\">Dodeca</a> has enabled them to get to the information they need to compete in the grocery industry.</p><p>02:15 PM - 03:15 PM<br>This is the most busy hour of the day on the Essbase track. If your organization is looking at a possible move to the cloud you will definitely not want to miss a <strong><a href=\"https://kscope19.odtug.com/e/in/eid=32&amp;s=2693&amp;req=info\">Case Study: How to Plan Your Migration from On-Prem Essbase to the Cloud</a></strong>. Likewise <a href=\"https://kscope19.odtug.com/e/in/eid=32&amp;s=2524&amp;req=info\"><strong>Get Your Forecast Rolling at the Speed of Light</strong></a> is definitely recommended if you or your organization is considering implementing this highly popular report. Also at this time the folks at GE bring you <strong><a href=\"https://kscope19.odtug.com/e/in/eid=32&amp;s=2627&amp;req=info\">Sleepless in Spreadsheets? Essbaseâ€¦Itâ€™s Nice to Meet You!</a> </strong>which promises to take a look at how one of the largest Oracle EPM customers uses the suite of products and how Dodeca makes it even better. Finally, Karen Zubetz from the Essbase Development team is going to talk about some tips, tricks and <strong>new</strong> features (including <a href=\"https://www.essbaselabs.com/2019/01/announcing-multi-cell-multi-region.html\">multi-cell drill through</a>) in <a href=\"https://kscope19.odtug.com/e/in/eid=32&amp;s=2679&amp;req=info\"><strong>Essbase Technical Tips and Tricks</strong></a>.</p><p>03:45 PM - 04:45 PM<br>In the final sessions of the day, the ever popular topic of the REST API makes it second appearance. So if you missed the first and are interested in what can be done via the API you might want to join <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/mike-larimer-a950aa1/\">Mike</a> for an <a href=\"https://kscope19.odtug.com/e/in/eid=32&amp;s=2628&amp;req=info\"><strong>Introduction to the Essbase REST API</strong></a>. Â If you are new to Essbase and its calculation methodologies or would like to learn a bit more you will probably want to check out <a href=\"https://kscope19.odtug.com/e/in/eid=32&amp;s=2694&amp;req=info\"><strong>My Favorite Calc Code</strong></a>. <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/ron-moore-02550/\">Ron</a> is hoping to help you learn by example by providing some strategies and code snippets. Lastly, we have our first panel discussion of the Essbase track in <a href=\"https://kscope19.odtug.com/e/in/eid=32&amp;s=2680&amp;req=info\"><strong>Essbase Design Architecture Panel</strong></a>. In this session, several Essbase architects will discuss past implementations and take questions from the crowd.</p><h2 id=\"tuesday\"><strong>Tuesday</strong></h2><p>08:50 AM - 09:50 AM<br>On this morning, there are three sessions to start your day on. First, Karen Zubetz who did <em>Essbase Technical Tips and Tricks</em> on Monday will discuss the Essbase product roadmap and try to explain how Essbase is setup to succeed for years to come in <strong><strong><a href=\"https://kscope19.odtug.com/e/in/eid=32&amp;s=2523&amp;req=info\">Essbase Product Roadmap and Reasons to Upgrade</a></strong></strong>. This same hour <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/jared-brame-40307a5/\">Jared</a> is going to share his tool (presumably VBA) for managing Essbase security in on-prem environments in <a href=\"https://kscope19.odtug.com/e/in/eid=32&amp;s=2695&amp;req=info\"><strong>Finally, an Easy Way to Monitor Essbase Security!</strong></a><strong> </strong>and he is planning on providing instructions for getting it setup in your environment. Lastly, <a href=\"http://essbasedownunder.com\">Pete</a> is inviting us to join him for <strong><a href=\"https://kscope19.odtug.com/e/in/eid=32&amp;s=2629&amp;req=info\">The Dark Art of BSO Essbase Optimization</a></strong>, in this session <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/peter-nitschke/\">Pete</a> is going to take the guesswork out of tuning Essbase and provide some examples and testing methodologies.</p><p>10:00 AM - 11:00 AM<br>The first thing to be aware of when looking at this time slot is that there is a hands-on session starting 15 minutes later that will cover Oracle Data Visualization (DV). If DV is something you are interested in you might want to skip these sessions. Next up Doug Pearce is going to discuss the various features of Essbase load rules in <strong><a href=\"https://kscope19.odtug.com/e/in/eid=32&amp;s=2696&amp;req=info\">Everything You Need to Know about Essbase Load Rules</a></strong> and it sounds like he is going to cover <a href=\"https://epmjunkie.com/formatted-formulas-using-load-rules/\">almost</a> everything. Another long time Essbase veteran, <a href=\"http://timtows-hyperion-blog.blogspot.com/\">Tim Tow</a>, is presenting an <a href=\"https://kscope19.odtug.com/e/in/eid=32&amp;s=2630&amp;req=info\"><strong>Introduction to Essbase MDX for Reporting</strong></a>. If MDX reporting is something of interest I highly suggest attending this since Tim probably knows as much as the Essbase developers (possibly more) about this kind of reporting.</p><p>10:15 AM - 11:45 AM<br>As stated earlier this hour and half session is a hands-on with <a href=\"https://www.oracle.com/solutions/business-analytics/data-visualization.html\">Oracle Data Visualization (DV)</a> in <a href=\"https://kscope19.odtug.com/e/in/eid=32&amp;s=2881&amp;req=info\"><strong>Hands-On Lab: Visual Analytics Made Simple with Oracle DV</strong></a>. DV is a great way to provide visual analysis for data in Essbase.</p><p>01:00 PM - 02:00 PM<br>You might want to grab your sack lunch and head over for this Panel discussion (<a href=\"https://kscope19.odtug.com/e/in/eid=32&amp;s=2911&amp;req=info\"><strong>Oracle Groundbreakers Lunch and Learn: Essbase Panel</strong></a>). Since this is pretty much the only thing going on, it's generally pretty popular and can be a good time to meet some of your fellow attendees.</p><p>2:15 PM - 03:15 PM<br>To start we have <strong><a href=\"https://kscope19.odtug.com/e/in/eid=32&amp;s=2684&amp;req=info\">Destination OACâ€”A Travelerâ€™s Guide: One Clientâ€™s Summer Adventure on the Journey from On-Prem</a></strong>, this is a look at migrating Essbase/Planning to Oracle Analytics Cloud (OAC), what changes had to made to achieve that goal and how administration changed in the process. Another option in this time slot is <strong><a href=\"https://kscope19.odtug.com/e/in/eid=32&amp;s=2697&amp;req=info\">Empowering Users with Analytical MDX</a></strong>, in this session <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/ron-moore-02550/\">Ron</a> will give attendees a primer on MDX and show how MDX can be used in SmartView to create reports that would otherwise not be possible. Finally <a href=\"https://www.jasonwjones.com/\">Jason Jones</a> is going to explore the Essbase (OAC) REST API and examine some of the differences versus the Java API in <strong><a href=\"https://kscope19.odtug.com/e/in/eid=32&amp;s=2631&amp;req=info\">Up &amp; Running with the OAC Essbase REST API</a></strong>.</p><p>03:45 PM - 04:45 PM<br>First in <a href=\"https://kscope19.odtug.com/e/in/eid=32&amp;s=2632&amp;req=info\"><strong>Do You Have Enough Juice? Load Testing Techniques for OACS Deployments</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://www.ecapitaladvisors.com/blog/author/jharvey/\">Jon Harvey</a> examines how load testing has changed in the cloud and how loads can be simulated. Next, <a href=\"https://kscope19.odtug.com/e/in/eid=32&amp;s=2685&amp;req=info\"><strong>Dodeca Beyond Essbase â€“ A SQL Interface for Streamlining DRM Change Request Workflows</strong></a> examines how <a href=\"https://www.lexisnexis.com\">LexisNexis</a> is using SQL and Dodeca in the Oracle DRM Governance process to speed up changes and satisfy SOX compliance. Then <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/mihaela-ciota-04421a5/\">Mihaela Ciota</a> details how <a href=\"https://www.abbott.com/\">Abbott</a> uses Dodeca, SQL and ASO applications to do long range (multiple years) planning and expense tracking for the medical industry in <a href=\"https://kscope19.odtug.com/e/in/eid=32&amp;s=2698&amp;req=info\"><strong>Trials and Tribulations</strong></a>.</p><h2 id=\"wednesday\"><strong>Wednesday</strong></h2><p>09:00 AM - 10:00 AM<br>You can start off the day with <strong><a href=\"https://kscope19.odtug.com/e/in/eid=32&amp;s=2686&amp;req=info\">ASO Tuning and Calculations</a></strong> where <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/tfaitsch/\">Tim</a> will explain how to optimize ASO applications and implement calculations. <a href=\"http://timtows-hyperion-blog.blogspot.com/\">Tim</a> Tow will explain how to get your on-prem application loaded into the cloud and what you need to get connected to it in <a href=\"https://kscope19.odtug.com/e/in/eid=32&amp;s=2633&amp;req=info\"><strong>Congratulations on Your Shiny New Oracle Analytics Cloud Essbase Account!

If haven't had a chance to get your hands on OAC this is highly recommended. It is also highly recommended that you arrive early as sometimes these can fill up fast. This lab promises to provide a ground up build of an Essbase cube as well as creation of visualizations using Oracle DV.</p><p>10:15 AM - 11:15 AM<br>There are three options if you aren't in the hands-on lab here. First, ShutterFly shares their secret sauce in <a href=\"https://kscope19.odtug.com/e/in/eid=32&amp;s=2687&amp;req=info\"><strong>Automate the Fixed Asset Roll Forward: Technical Deep Dive into Essbase, Oracle DB, Essbase Studio, and EBS Sources</strong></a>.

All this change has caused a lot of confusion and in many cases left clients with more questions than answers. A quick overview of the integration sessions being offered this year at <strong><a href=\"https://kscope19.odtug.com/\">Kscope19</a></strong>, show just how varied the toolkit is. In any case, this post will attempt to identify some key sessions that you might want to attend.</p><h2 id=\"monday\"><strong>Monday</strong></h2><p>The first integration session of the day (<a href=\"https://kscope19.odtug.com/e/in/eid=32&amp;s=2850&amp;req=info\">30-Minute Session: Become a RESTful Iron Man with ARC (the Application, Not the Reactor)</a>) is a short one, only 30 minutes but it should be more than enough for a quick deep dive. A lot has moved to REST API's including EPM the last couple years and this talk should be interesting for those that haven't seen it before (<a href=\"http://john-goodwin.blogspot.com/2015/09/planning-rest-api.html\">Here</a> <a href=\"https://onlyhyperion.blogspot.com/2017/09/Finally-REST-on-Oracle-PBCS.html\">are</a> <a href=\"https://www.quest4apps.com/python-and-epm-rest-apis/\">a</a> <a href=\"http://theunlockedcube.com/oracle/epbcs-rest-and-authentication/\">few</a> <a href=\"http://turrellconsulting.com/blog/?p=786\">EPM</a> <a href=\"http://orahyplabs.com/2016/09/generating-json-for-pbcs-rest-api.html\">specific</a>). In any case, if you can grasp <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON\">JSON</a>, you're half-way there and the REST is just figuring out what endpoints and methods are available. Developers can probably skip this one, but if you have zero exposure to REST this could be a really good session for you.</p><p>Next, is a dilemma, two sessions starting at the same time, I'm leaning towards <a href=\"https://kscope19.odtug.com/e/in/eid=32&amp;s=2509&amp;req=info\">Best Practices for Designing and Building Integrations</a>. My primary motivation would be because I did the EDMCS hands-on last year and I would like to see what kind of stuff others are doing with similar integration challenges.</p><p>If you haven't played with EDMCS yet, this could be a great introduction. Peloton did a great job with the EDMCS hands-on last year. Also, although we've heard some grumblings from clients about EDMCS not being enterprise ready yet, it's a pretty neat tool and a drastic departure from DRM.</p><h2 id=\"tuesday\"><strong>Tuesday</strong></h2><p>You are going to have to make a choice, do you want to find out about the future roadmap of data integration or are you just looking to <a href=\"https://kscope19.odtug.com/e/in/eid=32&amp;s=2512&amp;req=info\">simplify day to day management</a> of your environment. If you're anything like me, you want to see what's coming next, so I would highly recommend <a href=\"https://kscope19.odtug.com/e/in/eid=32&amp;s=2683&amp;req=info\">Oracle Data Management Update and Roadmap</a>. This is supposed to be an interactive session so if you have feature suggestions with regards to any of the data integration tools or maybe even the REST API this probably the best time to voice them.</p><p>It looks like Francisco has brewed up something as follow up his black-belt techniques from last year. Based on its description it's hard to get an idea of what's new in <a href=\"https://kscope19.odtug.com/e/in/eid=32&amp;s=2617&amp;print=1&amp;req=info\">OMG! That's Not in the Books: The Dark Arts of FDMEE &amp; DM</a> but he mentions something called \"Data Integration SUI\" which I have never heard of. If I had to guess, maybe some kind of data integration management interface but there aren't many details on the KScope site or his <a href=\"http://fishingwithfdmee.blogspot.com/2019/04/kscope19.html\">blog</a>. In any case, this should be one you don't want to miss, it will probably be one of the more technical integration sessions of the week and he generally shares everything he presents.</p><h2 id=\"wednesday\"><strong>Wednesday</strong></h2><p>This is hard decision, on one hand you have <a href=\"https://kscope19.odtug.com/e/in/eid=32&amp;s=2883&amp;req=info\">Hands-On Lab: Data Management Hacks to Turn You into a FDMEE Cloud Ninja!</a> with <a href=\"http://www.thinkfdm.com/\">Doug Correa</a> which I am sure will be great. On the other hand <a href=\"http://theunlockedcube.com/\">Vijay</a> has <a href=\"https://kscope19.odtug.com/e/in/eid=32&amp;s=2619&amp;req=info\">A Case for a Well Integrated EPM Cloud Solution with Oracle Integration Cloud Services (OICS)</a> which is followed by <a href=\"https://hyperionbarbie.wordpress.com/\">Kate</a> with <a href=\"https://kscope19.odtug.com/e/in/eid=32&amp;s=2516&amp;req=info\">EDMCS Application Adapters: Out of the Box and How to Create your Own!</a> Why are these at the same time? :( I generally prefer a hands-on session since I definitely learn by doing but I also feel like I know FDMEE extremely well so I would probably attend more sessions on OICS and EDMCS.</p><p>Unless you have a burning question, I would skip the panel, I went the previous two years and I can see where it would have value if you had a specific question but otherwise it seemed to lack value. I would love to see KScope do something similar to <a href=\"https://www.ng-conf.org\">NG-Conf</a> where they had a room dedicated to Q&amp;A where attendees could ask questions of speakers who were in the room at that time.</p><p>The last integration session of the day is <a href=\"https://kscope19.odtug.com/e/in/eid=32&amp;s=2519&amp;req=info\">Data Governance in the Cloud: EDMCS vs. DRM</a>. Personally I find Data Governance interesting but I realize there aren't a lot of clients that have DRM let alone DRG and probably even fewer with EDMCS.</p><h2 id=\"thursday\"><strong>Thursday</strong></h2><p>It is the only integration session of the day, so if you can manage to get out of bed after <a href=\"https://kscope19.odtug.com/page/special-event\">Wednesday night</a> (not judging), you will want to be at the <a href=\"https://kscope19.odtug.com/e/in/eid=32&amp;s=2887&amp;print=1&amp;req=info\">Deep Dive: EPM Data Integration</a>. This one promises to send you home with tips and tricks you can use when you get back to the office. Looking at the ensemble cast it should not disappoint.</p><p>If you are attending and would like to speak to someone from VeloMax, please reach out to <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/faraz-rahim\">Faraz</a> or <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/cortneybecker/\">Cortney</a>.

I wish I had the time to take advantage of some of the training sessions Monday and Tuesday, but it's hard to be away from home as my youngest is still less than a year old (Hi Cam from dad in the distant past if you're reading this.) So if your attending and want to say hi (I'm friendly) my first full day is Wednesday. This will be my second time attending NG-Conf in Salt Lake, and I made a promise to myself to be more prepared this year. I thought writing a blog would help me prepare and maybe it would highlight a few sessions that others might find interesting.</p><p>So first things first, if you are like I was last year, there are some things you might not know. There is a pretty great app available for <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pentamerous.confb1qfd2\">Android</a> and <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ng-conf-2019/id1452833084?mt=8\">Apple</a> that has the schedule, contacts management and some social networking built in. I highly recommend installing it and reviewing the sessions. Obviously you can do that on the website too, but the app lets you favorite items so you can plan your day, the app also has a nifty reminder feature. Next, unlike some other conferences I've attended, NG-Conf uses a hybrid model with Wednesday and Friday being single track and Thursday being multi-track. That last part is the main reason for planning ahead. I am going to try and identify one or two sessions in each time block that I think are interesting, this way I have short list of options to choose from day of (sometimes sessions fill up or maybe a speaker is having a off day, so it's good to have options.) Below I will highlight a few of those.</p><p>In the 11am spot I am probably going to attend <a href=\"https://2019.ng-conf.org/2019/sessions/productivity-revolution-angular-principles-in-node/\">Productivity Revolution: Angular Principals in Node</a>. If the title didn't give it away, it didn't for me, this topic seems to me to be about <a href=\"https://nestjs.com/\">NestJS</a>. If you see NestJS and think, ya okay, what is that, well in a nutshell it's a wrapper on <a href=\"https://expressjs.com/\">Express</a> to run <a href=\"https://www.typescriptlang.org/\">TypeScript</a> on Node. If that's still a bit cryptic think TypeScript as a back-end and let dreams of coding nirvana take you to a place where your entire app is written in one language...one can dream! Unfortunately for me, one of the other sessions I am interested in is in the same time slot!? <a href=\"https://2019.ng-conf.org/2019/sessions/crossing-across-platforms/\">Crossing Across Platforms</a> I assume will talk about writing an Angular app to run in browser, phone and on desktop (Electron.) It's going to be a game time decision.</p><p>Next, at 11:30, my go to will be <a href=\"https://2019.ng-conf.org/2019/sessions/testing-is-a-black-hole-of-time-and-effort-avoiding-the-suck-using-cypress/\">Testing is a Black hole of time and effort: Avoiding the suck using Cypress</a>. <a href=\"https://www.briebug.com/briebug-development-team/jesse-sanders/\">Jessie Sanders</a> is a good speaker and <a href=\"https://www.cypress.io/\">Cypress</a> seems to be all the rage when talking about next gen unit/integration testing in Angular (at least in the circles I run in). Even if its standing room only, I plan on being at this one.</p><p>The 12:30 slot is a big decision since this one of two longer sessions for the day. Once again there is a NestJS session <a href=\"https://2019.ng-conf.org/2019/sessions/amazing-backends-for-angular-devs-with-nestjs/\">Amazing Backends for Angular Devs with NestJS</a> and an equally interesting (maybe even more so for me), <a href=\"https://2019.ng-conf.org/2019/sessions/crash-course-angular-and-ngrx/\">Crash Course: Angular and NgRx</a>. Since I haven't had a chance to get down and dirty with NgRx yet, but have played with Nest in my free, I'll probably lean to NgRx.</p><p>At 2:30, the other long session, it all sounds really quite good. <a href=\"https://ionicframework.com/\">Ionic</a> is a really neat framework for cross platform, but I am probably going to choose between <a href=\"https://2019.ng-conf.org/2019/sessions/a-deep-look-at-angular-elements/\">A Deep Look at Angular Elements</a> and <a href=\"https://2019.ng-conf.org/2019/sessions/angular-and-css-grid-get-ready-to-fall-in-love/\">Angular and CSS Grid: Get ready to fall in love</a>. I feel a bit out of touch as I haven't looked at CSS Grid and probably need to do some pre-conference research. If it's cool, I'll probably lean that way, but I would like to see if Elements could help me out as I have an Angular 1.5 app that a client has given me the great ongoing pleasure of working with.</p><p>Last, I am completely clueless about the 7 o'clock hour, I like board games, but don't really know D&amp;D, Star Wars or really any of the other things, so I am open to suggestions. If you see me and have an opinion hit me up on in the app, on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/newbish\">twitter</a> (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/newbish\">@newbish</a>) or at the conference. Anyway, Salt Lake is only a few days away and I can't wait! Hope to see you there.</p><p>P.S. Go Rockets!</p>","comment_id":"5cc28761f6daae7a52105faa","feature_image":"https://ghost.tevpro.com/content/images/2019/04/Screenshot-2019-04-25-at-11.27.02-PM-2.png","featured":false,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"none","created_at":"2019-04-25T23:21:53.000-05:00","updated_at":"2020-06-23T10:43:59.000-05:00","published_at":"2019-04-26T09:43:00.000-05:00","custom_excerpt":"A
