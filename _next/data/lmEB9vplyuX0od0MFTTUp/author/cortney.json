But, like all technology trends, we see shifts in adoption and use cases. Increasingly, businesses are turning to PWAs because of their native app-like experiences, functionality, and cost-effective approach to development and maintenance. We have grown to love PWAs, and many clients we speak to are not aware of the significant advantages, so here are some situations where we might recommend PWAs to our clients:</p><h3 id=\"cross-platform-compatibility\">Cross-Platform Compatibility:</h3><p>PWAs are written using web standards and technology (HTML, CSS, JavaScript), so we can efficiently spin up PWAs that can run on any device. Your PWA will run on desktops, mobile, and IoT devices, reaching a broad audience across different devices.</p><h3 id=\"cost-efficiency\">Cost-Efficiency:</h3><p>Developing one PWA can be more affordable than building multiple apps on different platforms (iOS, Android, Windows). <a href=\"https://www.tevpro.com/blog/differences-between-pwas-and-native-mobile-apps-and-why-you-need-both\">Native Apps must be written for IOS and Android devices, which will increase development time and investment.</a> You can reach users on various platforms with a single PWA, reducing development and maintenance costs.</p><h3 id=\"progressive-enhancement\">Progressive Enhancement:</h3><p>At VeloMax, we pride ourselves on designing and building software that will stand the test of time, and PWAs are made with a \"progressive enhancement\" approach. This means they will work on older browsers and devices while providing a richer experience on modern ones. This future-proofs the application to some extent.</p><h3 id=\"improved-user-experience\">Improved User Experience:</h3><p>We love providing quick and easy wins for our clients. PWAs offer a smooth and responsive user experience, often resembling native apps. Features like offline access, push notifications, and quick loading times enhance user engagement and satisfaction. Clients appreciate the ease of use, speed, and improved digital experience.</p><h3 id=\"faster-deployment\">Faster Deployment:</h3><p>No one likes to wait for app store approval. PWAs are easier and faster to deploy than native apps because they don't require submission to app stores. You can update a PWA centrally on the server, eliminating the need for users to update the app manually. This simplifies the maintenance process. This agility is particularly beneficial when your client needs to quickly launch updates or new features.</p><h3 id=\"easier-installation\">Easier Installation:</h3><p>Installing a PWA is as simple as visiting a website; users don't need to go through app stores to download. Additionally, PWAs generally occupy less device storage compared to native apps, which can be appealing to users with limited storage space on their devices. This reduces the friction associated with app installations, leading to higher adoption rates.</p><h3 id=\"security\">Security:</h3><p>PWAs are served over HTTPS, which ensures data security and privacy. This can be crucial for clients dealing with sensitive user data.</p><h3 id=\"seo-and-discoverability\">SEO and Discoverability:</h3><p>PWAs are discoverable through search engines, which can improve your online visibility. They can attract more organic traffic since search engines can index the content within a PWA. Additionally, Web-based applications offer better analytics and tracking regarding user behavior and engagement, providing valuable insights for your client's business.</p><h3 id=\"scalability\">Scalability:</h3><p>PWAs can handle a large number of users without the need for major infrastructure changes, making them scalable for clients with varying levels of user demand.</p><h3 id=\"final-thoughts\">Final Thoughts</h3><p>When choosing the best approach for your business, consulting with an agnostic technology partner is essential. <a href=\"https://www.tevpro.com/about\">At Tevpro</a>, we like to dive deep and learn more about what is important to our clients and how they wish to improve their business processes. We believe that taking the time to think through the pros and cons of every possible solution helps our team build optimal strategies and avoids the time and hassle of turning the ship around midstream to fix preventable problems. </p><p>Whether you are considering a Native, Cross-Platform, Hybrid, or PWA, we love to provide the <a href=\"https://www.tevpro.com/blog/comparing-native-cross-platform-hybrid-pwa-mobile-applications\">pros and cons</a> of each option.</p><p>If you are looking for a technology partner with an unbiased approach, reach out to us.

Whether youâ€™re considering Native applications or Progressive Web Apps (PWAs), each type of application comes with different use cases.</p><h3 id=\"progressive-web-apps\">Progressive Web Apps</h3><p>PWAs are a baseline. Itâ€™s 2022 and your business must have a basic PWA. PWAs are essentially mobile applications built to run inside a web browser typically written in JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. PWAs are easily accessed on any type of device via a browser, allowing for a wider reach in audiences. They are relatively inexpensive to build and do not require the development of separate apps for each platform, making them easily deployable and updated since it <a href=\"https://www.tevpro.com/blog/comparing-native-cross-platform-hybrid-pwa-mobile-applications\">uses a single codebase</a>. All updates to the PWA are also made available to the user automatically; gone are the days a user would need to click a button to download or install updates to view the latest and greatest features. Ease of use and accessibility generally leads to higher usage of the app. </p><p>Another perk and also a hindrance for PWAs is discoverability. While PWAs are not submitted to the Apple or Android Store, they can be optimized for SEO. Since it is published inside a web browser, you can use search engines to your advantage. </p><h3 id=\"native-mobile-apps\">Native Mobile Apps</h3><p>Native Apps are for your most loyal customers. They want the fastest, best experience with your brand possible. </p><p>If you are an e-commerce, the Native app is for your frequent shoppers who are repeat customers who come back often to shop with you. They are your biggest spenders so they deserve the fastest experience possible, right? A native application would deliver the best user experience. Returning customers don't want to log in every time to check out your latest launch. They want their information safely saved, so checkout is almost too easy to resist; they could even have the choice to access the app in offline mode. The caveat to this is that the user would have to go through the installation process, which may deter them from downloading and using the app versus accessing the full application via a link.</p><p>There is no reuse of the codebase when it comes to Native Apps. Native Apps must be written for IOS and Android devices which will increase development time and investment.

Exceptional programmers care about WHO uses and maintains their code. They care about the PROCESS, not just the PRODUCT. They care about shipping code to production with minimal chances of regression and are able to spot problems before they happen, because of their past experience. But how do employers find these so-called â€œunicornâ€ software developers and programmers? </p><p>There are many things to consider - their skills, their experience, and whether they'll be a good fit for your team, but one of the best ways we have found to <strong>uncover meaningful insights into a developer's skill level is to get them talking.</strong> And the best way to get a candidate talking is to ask the right questions and be a good listener. This blog will give you some helpful interview questions to identify exceptional software developers by understanding more about their methodology, programming style, and problem-solving approach. <br></p><h3 id=\"1-tell-me-about-a-recent-project-you-worked-on-that-you-are-proud-of\">1. Tell me about a recent project you worked on that you are proud of.</h3><p>This question is simple, but it gives the candidate an opportunity to share a recent project and allows you the opportunity to further delve into their expertise with follow-up questions. We like to ask candidates to <strong>describe the project team</strong>, how many people worked within that team, and how they interacted throughout the project. <strong>Did they lead the project or just contribute?</strong> Did they interact directly with the client or end-user? Additionally, ask how they prefer to work within a project team. Are they silo contributors or thrive on team interaction? Discuss how that will translate and if that will be an ideal fit if the candidate decides to take a development role at your company.</p><h3 id=\"2-how-do-you-stay-abreast-of-the-latest-technology-news-and-announcements\">2. How do you stay abreast of the latest technology news and announcements?</h3><p>The best and brightest programmers want to know the latest news about their favorite tech stack, so this question should be easy for one to answer. For example, Angular developers might have a favorite blog or subscribe to an industry-specific newsletter. What about their favorite social media platform? What is the most recent tech conference or meetup you have attended or would like to attend? </p><p>By understanding how a developer keeps up with the latest technology trends, employers can <strong>get a better sense of their dedication and passion for their craft</strong>.</p><h3 id=\"3-what-is-your-favorite-programming-language-and-what-do-you-want-to-learn\">3. What is your favorite programming language and what do you want to learn?</h3><p>Ask about a developer's favorite programming language and youâ€™re sure to get an earful. People like talking about what they are passionate about and hopefully, this question can give you a sense of what kinds of projects and technologies they're most excited about. <strong>The key here is finding out <em>what they want to learn</em>.</strong> Continuous learning is a trait that sets apart exceptional programmers from the rest. Formal education shouldnâ€™t be a requirement for hiring programmers because many of the best developers are self-taught.</p><p>Are they front-end by trade and enjoy learning and teaching themselves about back-end solutions? Tell me about the last coding boot camp or conference you attended. Are they versed in Python but curious about React development? Or maybe theyâ€™ve always wanted to program in NestJS? One characteristic of exceptional programmers is their eagerness to learn, so this question can be a very useful gauge to identify talent. Â <br></p><h3 id=\"4-what-is-your-favorite-unit-testing-framework\">4. What is your favorite unit testing framework?</h3><p>Above-average programmers understand the importance of test-driven development. Performance and quality should be the big picture in their mind even before coding starts. We feel strongly that exceptional developers write their own unit tests or utilize one of the many unit testing frameworks to identify bugs and fixes before deploying code. Ask them about any processes they have experienced when shipping code to production. Were there verification layers in place to catch bugs before making it to production? What about having someone review their code before it's pushed? Did their previous team run integration tests or end-to-end tests before deployment? Knowing about their processes and previous work experience will you identify exceptional programmers from the rest. </p><h3 id=\"5-what-do-you-do-when-you-can%E2%80%99t-solve-a-problem\">5. What do you do when you canâ€™t solve a problem?</h3><p>Asking a candidate how they approached solving a particular problem is one of our favorite questions to ask. This question can help you get a better sense of how a developer thinks through difficult challenges to discover their methodology for solving tough problems. It also reveals whether a developer will ask for help or troubleshoot in their own way. Do they turn to Google to find answers? Do they pull out the documentation manual or start reading tutorials? </p><p>You want to avoid hiring a developer who ends up staring at a blank screen until your next stand-up meeting and giving excuses as to why they have been sitting idle. <strong>Learning more about their problem-solving approach</strong> will help you pick above-average programmers. Â  <br></p><h3 id=\"6-are-you-a-front-end-or-back-end-developer-and-which-do-you-prefer\">6. Are you a Front-end or Back-end developer and which do you prefer?</h3><p>This question will often yield a philosophical answer from an exceptional programmer. Both types of developers are vitally important, but <strong>dexterous programmers are exceptional</strong>. Developers are usually either Front-end or Back-end and rarely both. An exceptional back-end developer will appreciate the art of a good front-end design, and front-end developers wouldnâ€™t exist without a skillfully built and maintained back-end API. It is useful to know which type of development work the candidate prefers, but appreciation for both front and back-end development is ideal.</p><h3 id=\"final-thoughts\">Final thoughts</h3><p>We arenâ€™t saying this is a complete set of interview questions. <strong>We recommend having a skills assessment test and practical code reviews as part of the interview process</strong>, but we have found that these questions increase your chances of finding exceptional programmers. </p><p>Are you looking to hire an exceptional programmer?

Â </p><p>You're probably thinking this could never happen to you. While you may thoroughly vet the identity of your job applicants, check references, verify employment dates, or <strong>perform robust skills-testing techniques</strong>; it can happen to anyone. </p><h3 id=\"taking-the-bait\">Taking the Bait</h3><p>We recently uncovered a <strong>Catfishing scheme</strong> when my team nearly fell victim. It began as we posted our typical job description for a <strong>Senior Front-end Software Engineer </strong>opening<strong> </strong>and the resumes started to trickle in. Our human resources team sprung into action by contacting and prescreening the candidates. Prescreened candidates were passed on to a series of technical interviews conducted by the project manager and then a final interview with the hiring manager before we would make an offer to the candidate. </p><p>This so-called <em><strong>Catfish</strong> </em>made it to the final interview stage where they were ultimately hired. Weeks passed until we realized the scam. The candidate who reported for work, and who was now our newest employee, was NOT the candidate we originally interviewed, selected, and hired. After some fact-checking and further discovery, we realized we had been duped. </p><p>The Catfish was part of a group of scammers using a <em>bait and switch</em> method to con unknowing employers. By using a false identity, the Catfish would apply for the job, score high on the technical interview, and then send in a <strong>less qualified candidate</strong> to report to work once hired. It wouldnâ€™t be discovered until weeks later the employee on the job had none of the original skills we believed them to have when we initially interviewed the candidate. Â </p><p>We hope this never happens to your team, so here are some tips to help you avoid falling victim to a Catfishing scheme.</p><h3 id=\"tip-1-require-interviewees-to-use-their-camera\">Tip #1: Require Interviewees to Use Their Camera</h3><p>The number one rule when interviewing candidates virtually is to require the use of a camera and have the candidate turn ON their camera so you can see their face. Catfish who use a false identity will often be too afraid to come on camera and will use any excuse to keep from showing their face to protect their secret. We recommend taking a picture or screenshot to ensure the same candidate shows up for subsequent interviews.</p><h3 id=\"tip-2-verify-social-media-accounts-are-legit\">Tip #2: Verify Social Media Accounts Are Legit</h3><p>All job applicants should have their accounts on Twitter, Linkedin, and GitHub repositories inspected and verified for legitimacy. The same goes for any relative social media platform. Our recruitment process now requires any job applicants to show us their candidate profiles on Linkedin. Not having a Linkedin account in our opinion is highly suspicious. The LinkedIn profile must match the name on their resume and every employment experience included in their resume should link to any employers listed in their work history. Â </p><h3 id=\"tip-3-be-cautious-of-candidates-in-different-time-zones\">Tip #3: Be Cautious of Candidates in Different Time Zones</h3><p>This tip may not apply to every company, but we have found candidates in other time zones can more easily ghost projects due to a lack of timely communication. It's more difficult to ghost projects when you require participation in daily standups and have instant communication with them on Slack or Teams where applicable. We are cautious of offshore resources in general, but this is another reason to remain vigilant. </p><h3 id=\"tip-4-verify-credentials-and-certifications\">Tip #4: Verify Credentials and Certifications</h3><p>This step is critical when hiring a certified developer. Luckily, vendor websites like Salesforce Trailhead, AWS certification, and countless others offer public databases to verify certified developers. Some offer a number or certification ID that can be checked for validity. Additionally, there are aggregate reference checking tools and software that can be purchased for a nominal fee.

Once the <a href=\"https://onestreamsoftware.com/onestream-is-proud-to-be-a-profitable-unicorn/\">investment firm KKR took interest and gave it a unicorn valuation</a>, OneStream began ranking high in Gartner reports and â€œFastest-Growing Techâ€ blogs. </p><p>Now, <a href=\"https://onestreamsoftware.com/\">OneStream</a> is a grizzly bear lurking less in the shadows and more out in the open. Oracle should pay attention, because OneStream is coming for its market share.</p><p><strong>Oracle Hyperion falls short</strong></p><p>While Oracle Hyperion was good for its time, the common user sentiment is that it hasnâ€™t kept up.</p><p>â€œCustomers are painted into a corner when it comes to reporting and user interfaces, '' said Clint Holt, Managing Director at KTX Solutions. â€œThere is virtually no way to create custom, event-driven processes using native functionality. There is only one way to execute calculation scripts on the data.â€</p><p>On the other hand, OneStream is much more open.</p><p>â€œWe can create dashboards that can marry financial and operational data, initiate processes, and graphically display data in a fully customizable format. Weâ€™re also able to create integrations to other systems much easier than in the Oracle tools,â€ said Valerie York, Director of EPM Applications at VeloMax.</p><p>â€œIn general, Iâ€™m able to build and automate reliable processes in OneStream that help everyone whoâ€™s served by the data, '' continued York. â€œI like to think that my work helps decision-makers to gain confidence in the reliability of their reporting, and allows accountants and analysts to redirect their efforts from â€˜report building and preparation stepsâ€™ to analyzing their business, empowering them to be strategic leaders.â€</p><p><strong>OneStream certification courses are booked</strong></p><p>Every developer we speak to is eager to become a certified OneStream architect, but the courses are booked so far in advance that there arenâ€™t any available training dates in sight. We think itâ€™s a telling sign of whatâ€™s to come: Architects and developers are looking to catch the next wave of finance software. Clearly, we arenâ€™t alone in thinking OneStream is it.</p><p><strong>The price is right</strong></p><p>We see an opportunity for small- to medium-size businesses because of OneStreamâ€™s unique pricing structure. Itâ€™s their biggest differentiator, in our opinion. The fact that OneStream can replace the majority of software and contain this diverse functionality all within one tool with a single user license fee helps to reduce costs and makes it affordable for small- to medium-size companies. No longer do companies have to sacrifice leading-edge financial tools due to cost.</p><p>Additionally, OneStream has the flexibility and scalability to grow with companies and offer the right solutions at the right time.</p><p><strong>More focus on OneStream</strong></p><p>This is why, at VeloMax, weâ€™ve expanded our OneStream practice and have <a href=\"https://tevpro.com/blog/tevpro-expands-onestream-practice-with-new-director/\">hired a highly experienced OneStream practice director</a> who will oversee this strategic business unit.</p><p>All of our solutions architects complete rigorous OneStream certification courses and ongoing training for OneStream MarketPlace solutions. As a smaller firm, weâ€™re also able to enjoy a higher level of collaboration and idea-sharing within our team, which is especially important for more complex projects.</p><p>Our goal is to gain recognition for deploying highly talented solutions architects to deliver CPM tools for Fortune 2000 clients. We provide a quick and affordable OneStream implementation, knowledge transfer and ongoing support necessary to drive performance and deliver value.</p><p>Interested in discussing a switch to OneStream or having one of our highly trained solution architects take a look at your current configuration?

upgrade?","slug":"are-you-struggling-with-the-oracle-11-2-upgrade","html":"<p>Usually, implementing point release upgrades is a relatively minor endeavor. But upgrading on-prem users from 11.1.2.x to Oracle EPM 11.2 has revealed some particularly challenging issues you should be aware of.</p><p>You may be thinkingâ€”why am I hearing so much about the Oracle EPM 11.2 upgrade lately? The biggest reason we encourage clients to upgrade sooner rather than later is that <strong>Oracle will end premier support for EPM 11.1.2.x users in December 2021</strong> (<a href=\"https://www.oracle.com/us/assets/lifetime-support-applications-069216.pdf\">see page 41</a> of the Oracle support policy).</p><p>And if youâ€™re thinking that<a href=\"https://tevpro.com/blog/considering-an-oracle-hyperion-upgrade-on-your-own/\"> this upgrade is something you can easily handle in-house</a>, consider some of the nuances our EPM consultants have discovered while helping our clients with the 11.2 upgrade.</p><h3 id=\"the-necessity-of-technical-expertise\">The necessity of technical expertise</h3><p>Take for example <a href=\"https://tevpro.com/blog/life-without-epma-what-are-my-options-with-oracle-epm-11-2/\">EPM Architect (EPMA)</a>. Once you upgrade to 11.2, all prior versions of EPMA will no longer be available. If youâ€™re currently using EPMA to manage and share metadata across your EPM applications, be aware that<a href=\"https://tevpro.com/blog/restricted-use-drm/\"> Oracle Data Relationship Manager (DRM)</a>, doesnâ€™t have this functionality built in. Youâ€™ll need a dedicated resource or EPM specialist to perform technical validations, and more time than you care to set aside to implement this application. </p><p>The good news is that Oracle DRM is a powerful tool and offers you more flexibility and versatility. It provides more of a â€œsandboxâ€ around validation of metadata before deploying into your EPM destinations. However, be aware that \"more flexibility and versatility\" also means more complexity, countless configuration options, and likely the need for an experienced consultant to setup and maintain your DRM.</p><p>Another nuance we want to caution clients about is <strong>data synchronization.</strong> In 11.2, you wonâ€™t be able to use data synchronizations between EPMA applications to update non-numeric data. This means youâ€™ll lose functionality to process smart lists, text, and other non-numeric planning data types without substantial configuration in DRM. Without the optimal workaround for these lost functionalities, it could be disruptive to your business. We encourage you to call us before you attempt this upgrade. Having an EPM specialist on the job will save you time, money, and frustration.</p><h3 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion </h3><p>Unless EPM is your niche specialty, this all can seem overwhelming. In our experience helping clients upgrade to Oracle EPM 11.2 weâ€™ve successfully created and implemented workarounds for the issues outlined above, as well as many others. </p><p>Need help figuring out what your Oracle EPM 11.2 upgrade may involve and how to make the process successful?

Â In our business, we speak with a variety of Technology and Finance leaders about the challenges they face when it comes to optimizing their financial reporting and performance management systems. </p><p>Specifically, we work with <a href=\"https://tevpro.com/services/enterprise-performance-management/\">enterprise performance management</a> (EPM) leaders and their counterparts who have successfully confronted their legacy and change-averse processes and chartered their organization through a technology and <a href=\"https://itrevolution.com/the-unicorn-project/\">cultural transformation</a>.</p><p>There are many people, processes, and systems to consider while developing your EPM strategy. In this blog, series we hope to share some insights to ensure every piece of your strategy is complete.</p><h2 id=\"put-purpose-at-the-center\">Put purpose at the center </h2><p>Many companies consider purpose merely an addition to their strategy, but the most <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2019/09/put-purpose-at-the-core-of-your-strategy\">successful companies put it at their core</a>. You can take a retrospective approach which requires you to look back on the past or you can be prospective and visualize the possibilities of where you want to be in the future. Where can we go? Which trends will impact our financials or impede growth? What new challenges and opportunities lie ahead? </p><p>The journey begins by looking within. Find what challenges your employees face with their current processes and analytics platforms. Start by conducting internal surveys between managers and employees of all levels. Encourage open dialog and sharing of information. Leaders will more effectively accomplish sustainable business outcomes if they put purpose at the center of their EPM strategy. </p><h2 id=\"identify-gaps-between-your-current-and-future-processes\">Identify gaps between your current and future processes</h2><p>The first step in moving your business forward is understanding your starting position. Peel back the layers and identify which areas of your organization needs improvement. Â </p><p>For example, letâ€™s say you are looking for better ways to manage your financial data, you could be in the market for a financial planning or forecasting solution. You will need a thorough evaluation of data availability and your current infrastructure in order to map pain points to solutions. </p><p>By spending time evaluating and monitoring current processes you can begin to map out the internal and external resources needed to improve these functions.</p><h2 id=\"deepen-ties-with-stakeholders\">Deepen ties with stakeholders </h2><p>Engaging with key stakeholders may seem like a bunch of buzzwords, but it's one of the most critical factors. Nominate project managers and organized leaders who can communicate effectively with team members and take initiative. Often times, EPM implementation tasks will be done outside of day-to-day activities so you need personnel who will go the extra mile. Â </p><p>Most employees don't understand how they are connected to the strategy. Make it clear to everyone in the organization that their role is important and make sure everyone understands what they should be doing. Motivate employees daily on how their work impacts the overall strategy. Allow them to operate freely, ask questions, submit ideas and work across organizational silos to tackle cross-functional challenges.</p><h2 id=\"finding-the-right-epm-tools\">Finding the right EPM tools Â </h2><p>There is no one-size-fits all approach to improving EPM performance. If your organization is currently on-premise, does it have cloud initiatives, or do you seek an out-of-the box solution? Prioritize your requirements.</p><p>The cost of EPM software, ease of integration and access control of each solution will vary greatly. We work with multiple EPM technologies â€“ <a href=\"https://www.oracle.com/applications/performance-management/\">Oracle</a>, <a href=\"https://www.onestreamsoftware.com/\">OneStream</a>, <a href=\"https://www.anaplan.com/\">Anaplan</a>, and others -so we suggest weighing the pros and cons and being completely transparent about any limitations.</p><p>No oneâ€™s EPM journey is the same, but there are resources available to help you ensure that every piece of your EPM strategy is complete. </p><p><strong>If you like our content and want more tutorials, sign up for our monthly newsletter below.
