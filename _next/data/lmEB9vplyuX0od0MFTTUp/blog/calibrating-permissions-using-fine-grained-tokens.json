PATs are mighty for allowing processes running inside a <em>GitHub Action</em> to perform actions like committing code, automating issue creation on build failures, generating tags, or creating releases by acting as a password to impersonate a user. </p><p>Until recently, there wasn't a great way to limit where PATs exercise this power. Fortunately, in October 2022, GitHub introduced <a href=\"https://github.blog/2022-10-18-introducing-fine-grained-personal-access-tokens-for-github/\">Fine-Grained Personal Access Tokens</a> (FG-PATs) (in beta). </p><h3 id=\"what-are-fine-grained-personal-access-tokens\">What are Fine-Grained Personal Access Tokens?</h3><p>With the public beta, Fine-Grained Personal Access Tokens (FG-PATs) offer you greater control over permissions and features that can be used when triggering an action. Using FG-PATs, you can control repository permissions such as workflow access, codespaces, metadata access, and more. </p><h3 id=\"setting-repository-permissions\">Setting Repository Permissions</h3><p>GitHub through FG-PATs allows you to limit their scope by specifying which repositories they can be used. </p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://static.tevpro.com/content/images/2022/12/image-1.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1598\" height=\"814\" srcset=\"https://static.tevpro.com/content/images/size/w600/2022/12/image-1.png 600w, https://static.tevpro.com/content/images/size/w1000/2022/12/image-1.png 1000w, https://static.tevpro.com/content/images/2022/12/image-1.png 1598w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"><figcaption>Fine-Grained Personal Access Token - Repository Selection</figcaption></figure><p>When working with clients, these new limits in scope make it vastly safer for our team by eliminating the possibility of a bad actor using one of our accounts/PATs to cross organizations (clients).</p><h3 id=\"calibrating-semantic-release-permissions\">Calibrating Semantic-Release Permissions</h3><p>Semantic-Release provides <a href=\"https://github.com/semantic-release/github#github-authentication\">documentation</a> about what permissions are required for using GitHub Actions. However, upon reading this <a href=\"https://github.com/semantic-release/github#github-authentication\">documentation</a>, you will find that it does not yet cover <strong>Fine-Grained Personal Access Tokens (FG-PATs).</strong> Through some trial and error, we have found that the following permissions enable Semantic-Release to be run via GitHub Action.</p><ul><li>Actions - Access: Read/Write</li><li>Commit Statuses - Access: Read-only</li><li>Contents - Access: Read/Write</li><li>Issues - Access: Read/Write</li><li>Metadata - Access: Read-only</li><li>Pull Requests - Access: Read-only</li></ul><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://static.tevpro.com/content/images/2023/02/image-2.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1614\" height=\"1020\" srcset=\"https://static.tevpro.com/content/images/size/w600/2023/02/image-2.png 600w, https://static.tevpro.com/content/images/size/w1000/2023/02/image-2.png 1000w, https://static.tevpro.com/content/images/size/w1600/2023/02/image-2.png 1600w, https://static.tevpro.com/content/images/2023/02/image-2.png 1614w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><h3 id=\"final-thoughts\">Final thoughts</h3><p>Semantic-Release is necessary for automating project releases, and with fine-grained PATs, we now have even greater control over what actions can be performed.
