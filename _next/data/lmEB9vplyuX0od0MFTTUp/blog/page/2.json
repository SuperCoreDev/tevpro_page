Exceptional programmers care about WHO uses and maintains their code. They care about the PROCESS, not just the PRODUCT. They care about shipping code to production with minimal chances of regression and are able to spot problems before they happen, because of their past experience. But how do employers find these so-called “unicorn” software developers and programmers? </p><p>There are many things to consider - their skills, their experience, and whether they'll be a good fit for your team, but one of the best ways we have found to <strong>uncover meaningful insights into a developer's skill level is to get them talking.</strong> And the best way to get a candidate talking is to ask the right questions and be a good listener. This blog will give you some helpful interview questions to identify exceptional software developers by understanding more about their methodology, programming style, and problem-solving approach. <br></p><h3 id=\"1-tell-me-about-a-recent-project-you-worked-on-that-you-are-proud-of\">1. Tell me about a recent project you worked on that you are proud of.</h3><p>This question is simple, but it gives the candidate an opportunity to share a recent project and allows you the opportunity to further delve into their expertise with follow-up questions. We like to ask candidates to <strong>describe the project team</strong>, how many people worked within that team, and how they interacted throughout the project. <strong>Did they lead the project or just contribute?</strong> Did they interact directly with the client or end-user? Additionally, ask how they prefer to work within a project team. Are they silo contributors or thrive on team interaction? Discuss how that will translate and if that will be an ideal fit if the candidate decides to take a development role at your company.</p><h3 id=\"2-how-do-you-stay-abreast-of-the-latest-technology-news-and-announcements\">2. How do you stay abreast of the latest technology news and announcements?</h3><p>The best and brightest programmers want to know the latest news about their favorite tech stack, so this question should be easy for one to answer. For example, Angular developers might have a favorite blog or subscribe to an industry-specific newsletter. What about their favorite social media platform? What is the most recent tech conference or meetup you have attended or would like to attend? </p><p>By understanding how a developer keeps up with the latest technology trends, employers can <strong>get a better sense of their dedication and passion for their craft</strong>.</p><h3 id=\"3-what-is-your-favorite-programming-language-and-what-do-you-want-to-learn\">3. What is your favorite programming language and what do you want to learn?</h3><p>Ask about a developer's favorite programming language and you’re sure to get an earful. People like talking about what they are passionate about and hopefully, this question can give you a sense of what kinds of projects and technologies they're most excited about. <strong>The key here is finding out <em>what they want to learn</em>.</strong> Continuous learning is a trait that sets apart exceptional programmers from the rest. Formal education shouldn’t be a requirement for hiring programmers because many of the best developers are self-taught.</p><p>Are they front-end by trade and enjoy learning and teaching themselves about back-end solutions? Tell me about the last coding boot camp or conference you attended. Are they versed in Python but curious about React development? Or maybe they’ve always wanted to program in NestJS? One characteristic of exceptional programmers is their eagerness to learn, so this question can be a very useful gauge to identify talent.  <br></p><h3 id=\"4-what-is-your-favorite-unit-testing-framework\">4. What is your favorite unit testing framework?</h3><p>Above-average programmers understand the importance of test-driven development. Performance and quality should be the big picture in their mind even before coding starts. We feel strongly that exceptional developers write their own unit tests or utilize one of the many unit testing frameworks to identify bugs and fixes before deploying code. Ask them about any processes they have experienced when shipping code to production. Were there verification layers in place to catch bugs before making it to production? What about having someone review their code before it's pushed? Did their previous team run integration tests or end-to-end tests before deployment? Knowing about their processes and previous work experience will you identify exceptional programmers from the rest. </p><h3 id=\"5-what-do-you-do-when-you-can%E2%80%99t-solve-a-problem\">5. What do you do when you can’t solve a problem?</h3><p>Asking a candidate how they approached solving a particular problem is one of our favorite questions to ask. This question can help you get a better sense of how a developer thinks through difficult challenges to discover their methodology for solving tough problems. It also reveals whether a developer will ask for help or troubleshoot in their own way. Do they turn to Google to find answers? Do they pull out the documentation manual or start reading tutorials? </p><p>You want to avoid hiring a developer who ends up staring at a blank screen until your next stand-up meeting and giving excuses as to why they have been sitting idle. <strong>Learning more about their problem-solving approach</strong> will help you pick above-average programmers.   <br></p><h3 id=\"6-are-you-a-front-end-or-back-end-developer-and-which-do-you-prefer\">6. Are you a Front-end or Back-end developer and which do you prefer?</h3><p>This question will often yield a philosophical answer from an exceptional programmer. Both types of developers are vitally important, but <strong>dexterous programmers are exceptional</strong>. Developers are usually either Front-end or Back-end and rarely both. An exceptional back-end developer will appreciate the art of a good front-end design, and front-end developers wouldn’t exist without a skillfully built and maintained back-end API. It is useful to know which type of development work the candidate prefers, but appreciation for both front and back-end development is ideal.</p><h3 id=\"final-thoughts\">Final thoughts</h3><p>We aren’t saying this is a complete set of interview questions. <strong>We recommend having a skills assessment test and practical code reviews as part of the interview process</strong>, but we have found that these questions increase your chances of finding exceptional programmers. </p><p>Are you looking to hire an exceptional programmer?  Do you need help building a custom application or software development?

While you may thoroughly vet the identity of your job applicants, check references, verify employment dates, or <strong>perform robust skills-testing techniques</strong>; it can happen to anyone. </p><h3 id=\"taking-the-bait\">Taking the Bait</h3><p>We recently uncovered a <strong>Catfishing scheme</strong> when my team nearly fell victim. It began as we posted our typical job description for a <strong>Senior Front-end Software Engineer </strong>opening<strong> </strong>and the resumes started to trickle in. Our human resources team sprung into action by contacting and prescreening the candidates. Prescreened candidates were passed on to a series of technical interviews conducted by the project manager and then a final interview with the hiring manager before we would make an offer to the candidate. </p><p>This so-called <em><strong>Catfish</strong> </em>made it to the final interview stage where they were ultimately hired. Weeks passed until we realized the scam. The candidate who reported for work, and who was now our newest employee, was NOT the candidate we originally interviewed, selected, and hired. After some fact-checking and further discovery, we realized we had been duped. </p><p>The Catfish was part of a group of scammers using a <em>bait and switch</em> method to con unknowing employers. By using a false identity, the Catfish would apply for the job, score high on the technical interview, and then send in a <strong>less qualified candidate</strong> to report to work once hired. It wouldn’t be discovered until weeks later the employee on the job had none of the original skills we believed them to have when we initially interviewed the candidate.  </p><p>We hope this never happens to your team, so here are some tips to help you avoid falling victim to a Catfishing scheme.</p><h3 id=\"tip-1-require-interviewees-to-use-their-camera\">Tip #1: Require Interviewees to Use Their Camera</h3><p>The number one rule when interviewing candidates virtually is to require the use of a camera and have the candidate turn ON their camera so you can see their face. Catfish who use a false identity will often be too afraid to come on camera and will use any excuse to keep from showing their face to protect their secret. We recommend taking a picture or screenshot to ensure the same candidate shows up for subsequent interviews.</p><h3 id=\"tip-2-verify-social-media-accounts-are-legit\">Tip #2: Verify Social Media Accounts Are Legit</h3><p>All job applicants should have their accounts on Twitter, Linkedin, and GitHub repositories inspected and verified for legitimacy. The same goes for any relative social media platform. Our recruitment process now requires any job applicants to show us their candidate profiles on Linkedin. Not having a Linkedin account in our opinion is highly suspicious. The LinkedIn profile must match the name on their resume and every employment experience included in their resume should link to any employers listed in their work history.  </p><h3 id=\"tip-3-be-cautious-of-candidates-in-different-time-zones\">Tip #3: Be Cautious of Candidates in Different Time Zones</h3><p>This tip may not apply to every company, but we have found candidates in other time zones can more easily ghost projects due to a lack of timely communication. It's more difficult to ghost projects when you require participation in daily standups and have instant communication with them on Slack or Teams where applicable. We are cautious of offshore resources in general, but this is another reason to remain vigilant. </p><h3 id=\"tip-4-verify-credentials-and-certifications\">Tip #4: Verify Credentials and Certifications</h3><p>This step is critical when hiring a certified developer. Luckily, vendor websites like Salesforce Trailhead, AWS certification, and countless others offer public databases to verify certified developers. Some offer a number or certification ID that can be checked for validity. Additionally, there are aggregate reference checking tools and software that can be purchased for a nominal fee.  </p><h3 id=\"final-thoughts\">Final Thoughts</h3><p>Catfishing schemes in the developing world can cost your project time and money. It can also be detrimental to your company's reputation, especially if you are subcontracting work through other firms. If you discover you’ve fallen victim to this deceitful practice, immediately remove the perpetrator and reconcile your losses. It's a lesson some learn the hard way. The only way to stop Catfishing in the programming world is to expose this deceitful practice and shame them into extinction. We hope these tips will help you stay aware and informed. </p><p>Have you been a victim of the catfishing scheme or know someone who has? <a href=\"https://www.tevpro.com/contact-us\">Share your</a> experience and feedback anytime on <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/tevpro/\">Linkedin</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Tevpro\">Twitter</a>. <br></p>","comment_id":"62e81beb747d11e1211d0058","feature_image":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1602529710584-458a995c8785?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&ixid=MnwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDU5fHxoYWNrZXJ8ZW58MHx8fHwxNjU5NDQzMDky&ixlib=rb-1.2.1&q=80&w=2000","featured":false,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"all","created_at":"2022-08-01T13:31:07.000-05:00","updated_at":"2022-09-21T05:37:57.000-05:00","published_at":"2022-08-02T14:09:36.000-05:00","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"tags":[{"id":"614576dd0192c52f3a498d45","name":"Development","slug":"development","description":null,"feature_image":null,"visibility":"public","og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"meta_title":"Software Development","meta_description":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"canonical_url":null,"accent_color":null,"url":"https://ghost.tevpro.com/tag/development/"},{"id":"62e975a9747d11e1211d02ba","name":"Programming Life","slug":"programming-life","description":null,"feature_image":null,"visibility":"public","og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"canonical_url":null,"accent_color":null,"url":"https://ghost.tevpro.com/tag/programming-life/"}],"authors":[{"id":"614576dc0192c52f3a498d16","name":"Cortney Becker","slug":"cortney","profile_image":"https://ghost.tevpro.com/content/images/2020/02/cortney.jpg","cover_image":"https://ghost.tevpro.com/content/images/2020/02/CP0A0966.jpg","bio":"Marketing Manager","website":null,"location":null,"facebook":null,"twitter":null,"meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"url":"https://ghost.tevpro.com/author/cortney/"}],"primary_author":{"id":"614576dc0192c52f3a498d16","name":"Cortney Becker","slug":"cortney","profile_image":"https://static.tevpro.com/content/images/2020/02/cortney.jpg","cover_image":"https://ghost.tevpro.com/content/images/2020/02/CP0A0966.jpg","bio":"Marketing Manager","website":null,"location":null,"facebook":null,"twitter":null,"meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"url":"https://ghost.tevpro.com/author/cortney/"},"primary_tag":{"id":"614576dd0192c52f3a498d45","name":"Development","slug":"development","description":null,"feature_image":null,"visibility":"public","og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"meta_title":"Software Development","meta_description":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"canonical_url":null,"accent_color":null,"url":"https://ghost.tevpro.com/tag/development/"},"url":"https://ghost.tevpro.com/blog/fake-programmers-catfishing-scams-and-how-to-avoid-them/","excerpt":"We’ve all heard of the MTV reality series, Catfish: the TV show, where one\nlovestruck individual falls victim to an online dating predator who uses a fake\nidentity to compromise the victim in some way; either for monetary gain or some\nother deceitful reasoning (1 [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catfishing]).\n\n> “Catfishing [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catfishing] is a deceptive activity\nwhere a person creates a fictional persona or fake identity on a social\nnetworking service, usually targeting","reading_time":3,"access":true,"send_email_when_published":true,"og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"meta_title":"Fake programmers, catfishing scams, and how to avoid them","meta_description":"Catfishing in the programming world occurs when a fake job applicant applies to a legitimate job opening using a fake resume, interviews for the position, and then 'ghosts' the job with an insufficient developer who is grossly underqualified.

Notifications can also be set up to automatically notify the required users once certain actions have been completed.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://ghost.tevpro.com/content/images/2022/02/image-1.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"975\" height=\"527\" srcset=\"https://ghost.tevpro.com/content/images/size/w600/2022/02/image-1.png 600w, https://ghost.tevpro.com/content/images/2022/02/image-1.png 975w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"><figcaption><strong>Figure 2&nbsp;</strong></figcaption></figure><p>To run the reports, there is a simple four (4) step process from the home page.
