They needed to modernize their hardware and operating systems to mitigate vulnerabilities and do so, with minimal downtime and disruption for their customers. Â </p><h3 id=\"major-obstacles-\">Major Obstacles: </h3><ul><li>Highly vulnerable web sessions using <strong>SSL on legacy Microsoft Windows Servers</strong>, due to <strong>deprecated TLS 1.0 &amp; 1.1</strong>, which no longer receive security patches or assisted technical support. Â  </li><li><strong>On-premise backups were cumbersome</strong> and time-consuming with restoration from backup taking hours to complete.</li><li><strong>MySQL databases hadn't been updated</strong> or patched in years. </li><li>Legacy server software, <strong>Adobe ColdFusion</strong>, was outdated and required nightly reboots. </li></ul><p>OMI selected VeloMax in their legacy modernization efforts to move outdated applications onto current Windows Server releases and migrate them into the <strong>Microsoft Azure Cloud</strong>. Upon moving OMI to the cloud, VeloMax wanted to provide unprecedented speed, the volume of data, security, and ultimately, business value through cost and time savings.</p><h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2><p>Our first goal was to ensure OMI's clinical evaluations being performed were secure from the moment the web browser sessions began to storing the results securely in the database. </p><p>To secure the web sessions,<strong> our team deployed a reverse proxy server in front of OMI's legacy servers </strong>while we remedied the issues among the legacy infrastructure and software.</p><p>The reverse proxy allowed us to put another<strong> secure layer in front of the application servers.</strong> We set up automated SSL renewals using <strong>Let's Encrypt</strong>, so OMI would never need to worry about purchasing or managing future SSL renewals. </p><p>To fix the legacy infrastructure issues, we utilized the <a href=\"https://tevpro.com/blog/legacy-system-modernization-tactics/\">Lift and Shift</a> approach to migrate legacy servers from a co-location facility in Houston to <strong>Microsoft's Azure Cloud</strong>. Overall, this allowed us to remedy the hardware issues and improve the overall stability and security of the servers.</p><p>As for the databases, we decided to migrate all databases to <strong>Azure Database for MySQL</strong>. This lowered the overall maintenance cost while providing a more scalable database with proven backup and restoration protocols. </p><p>When it came to the software stack, we evaluated proprietary and open-source options for moving the <strong>Adobe</strong> <strong>ColdFusion applications to the cloud</strong>. High-traffic systems can get expensive when running ColdFusion in the cloud so we wanted to mitigate that cost. After some initial research and testing, we found that the open-source <strong>CFML server </strong><a href=\"https://lucee.org/\"><strong>Lucee</strong></a> suited our needs.</p><h2 id=\"results\">Results</h2><p>We knew that moving to the cloud would be a big win for OMI in terms of cost savings and reduced maintenance time, but even we were shocked by some of the findings after successfully migrating to Microsoft Azure Cloud. </p><h3 id=\"benefits-of-migrating-to-microsoft-azure-cloud-\">Benefits of migrating to Microsoft Azure Cloud: </h3><ul><li>We are saving our client money by running the applications on smaller server instances. Â </li><li>By moving the Adobe ColdFusion applications to the cloud, using the open-source CFML server Lucee, it runs much faster, handles greater volumes of data, and uses less memory. </li><li>No more scheduled tasks for server reboots or service restarts are required, which means zero downtime.</li><li>Automated database and server backups are more reliable and restoring from a backup is a breeze. </li><li>Patching infrastructure is much faster in the cloud. </li><li>The client is able to automate disaster recovery.</li><li>SSL certificate renewals are now free and completely automated, saving both time and money.</li><li>We reduced infrastructure costs by running on Azure Cloud versus maintaining \"on-premise\" servers at a co-location space.</li></ul><h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion </h2><p>Modernizing your legacy applications can be easier and take less time than you think. At VeloMax, we don't believe in a \"one-size-fits-all\" approach when it comes to the tools and technology we recommend for our clients. Not every business case requires a move to the cloud and in some instances, we can breathe new life into your current legacy system or <a href=\"https://www.tevpro.com/blog/tips-for-automating-and-unifying-the-financial-close-and-reporting-process\">automate and unify</a> financial and business processes.
