The original developers were nowhere to be found and maintenance was a constant challenge. The complexity of the application meant a simple conversion was not possible and it must be rewritten in modern technology. The application relied on intricate interest calculations and financial modeling that required Tevpro’s accounting and financial expertise.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"approach\"\u003eApproach\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eTevpro was hired to re-platform and re-architect the legacy MS Access application to a modern web application.

The Company offers high-quality, science-backed products, sold in over 90 countries by entrepreneurs who provide one-on-one coaching and a supportive community that inspires their customers to embrace a healthier, more active lifestyle. Herbalife Nutrition has over 9,300 employees and generates over $4.8B in annual revenue.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor more information, visit \u003ca href=\"https://www.herbalife.com/\"\u003eHerbalife.com\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"IAmHerbalifeNutrition.com\"\u003eIAmHerbalifeNutrition.com\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"the-challenge\"\u003eThe Challenge\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eHerbalife Nutrition operates in ninety countries and had multiple legacy CPM products in place including Oracle Hyperion (HFM), Planning, FDM, Essbase and EPMA. Managing data across several applications, the Company had a very manual Excel-based process for modeling and reporting.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e“We were integrating from many different applications, including Oracle ERP to multiple Oracle Hyperion applications, yet they were all behaving independently,” said Vanita Thornton, Sr. Director Global Operational Accounting and Financial Systems at Herbalife Nutrition.\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eThese legacy systems were limited by dimensionality which hindered the Company’s ability to report on project-level detail. It was time for the Company to make a choice—take on a major upgrade, move to the cloud, or start looking at alternative solutions.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSeeking to learn more about Oracle’s product roadmap, Herbalife Nutrition was ready to explore the market. OneStream was ultimately selected because it best complimented the Company’s system requirements to have all solutions in one product.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"implementing-a-unified-cpm-platform\"\u003eImplementing a Unified CPM Platform\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe first phase of implementation included global consolidations for 80 markets, global expense planning, and people planning with direct integration with their Oracle Fusion HCM system. With 600 accounting and FP\u0026amp;A users globally, Herbalife Nutrition went live with 2.5 years of data conversion in just 10 months in a complete “rip and replace” of Hyperion Planning, Essbase and HFM.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThree months later, they went live with a Transfer Profit solution and today they are using People Planning, Parcel Service, and Diagnostics 123 solutions from the OneStream MarketPlaceTM.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e“People Planning added more flexibility with the way we calculate compensation. Integrating directly with our HR system gives us more control and accurate data,” said Neal Yeung, Director of Financial Systems FP\u0026amp;A at Herbalife Nutrition.\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"transfer-profit-analysis\"\u003eTransfer Profit Analysis\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eWith 90+ entities and 30+ currencies, Herbalife Nutrition manages a high volume of intercompany sales activity. As such, they are uniquely using OneStream as a solution to calculate the transfer profit in ending inventory, prepare the monthly elimination journal entry and assess the FX impact to cost of sales (calculation based on estimated quantities sold in the month).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e“OneStream helps me to perform a very complicated calculation.” Thornton explains. “For example, our own manufacturing plants purchase raw material from both internal and external suppliers. Once the products are made, the related finished products would sell to our own distribution entities in US and in Luxembourg before they sell to other Herbalife entities. As such, many of our SKUs have multi-levels of transfer profit in different currencies that became impossible for anyone to perform the calculation of manually. OneStream has enabled us to easily peel back the layers and prepare our monthly elimination entries. Further, various reports are available in OneStream for the users to review the month-to-month fluctuation at item level by entity.”\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"process-improvements-and-more\"\u003eProcess Improvements and More\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eWith OneStream, everything is now in one place for analysis. Cash flow reporting is automated, and the end users have access to reporting and analysis tools including the Excel add-in, dashboards and Cube Views. Financial statement analysis that was previously done in SharePoint is now also done in OneStream. Herbalife Nutrition is also leveraging Guided Workflow approvals to handle statement analysis forms, which are now easier to update, comment and track.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOn the FP\u0026amp;A side, the company is using a driver-based rolling forecast to seed next year’s budget by forecasting revenue and expenses. “Our new planning process using workflows helped to streamline how data was entered and calculated and to provide results quicker, with more transparency,” said Yeung. “We are relying less on manual processes with direct integration of HR data. We’re now able to go back to the source and consolidate information much quicker.

The Company also manufactures and markets infrastructure and road safety products under the Lindsay Transportation Solutions trade name. Lindsay is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol LNN.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“The OneStream solution has given us the capability to wrap up the monthly close process by day 5, which is at least a 25% improvement. This has enabled faster management reporting, and more agile decision-making. We were spending too much time reconciling data.

Additionally, Business Units now get their data right away and don’t have to wait until the corporate results are finalized.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e— Brian Ketcham | VP and Chief Financial Officer\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"the-challenge\"\u003eThe Challenge\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs a global company with multiple business units, reliance on Excel spreadsheets and their Microsoft Dynamics Navision general ledger (GL) for financial consolidation, reporting, budgeting and forecasting was no longer sufficient. These critical financial processes relied on manual efforts and took too long. Finance executives didn’t have visibility into the right level of operational detail, or impacts of currency rates on their financial results.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGetting through the monthly financial close, forecast updates and preparation for monthly business reviews using their existing tools and processes required a full two weeks – delaying delivery of management information and review of business performance. And business unit (BU) Controllers were spending too much time on data manipulation and not enough on analysis and supporting decision-making. It was time for a change.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"the-onestream-xf-solution\"\u003eThe OneStream XF Solution\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eWith a preference towards cloud applications, the company evaluated Oracle’s EPM Cloud applications along with OneStream XF’s unified platform.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e“OneStream was a better choice for us,” said Brian Ketcham, VP and Chief Financial Officer at Lindsay. “OneStream’s unified approach would be easier to maintain, easier to upgrade, and provide a lower TCO vs. Oracle. Plus, the OneStream team did a great job demonstrating the solution, and ensuring the Lindsay team they could capture our financial results at the right level of detail.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"simplifying-and-aligning-consolidation-reporting-budgeting-and-forecasting\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSimplifying and Aligning Consolidation, Reporting, Budgeting and Forecasting\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eLindsay implemented OneStream XF Cloud for financial consolidation and reporting of actual financial results. They also use the platform for budgeting and monthly forecasting. OneStream’s unified SmartCPM™ platform is used to collect and consolidate data from 20 different GLs, with eight currencies, and different charts of accounts being mapped to OneStream.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith a high volume of intercompany transactions, responsibility for reconciling intercompany accounts is now pushed to the BU level vs. corporate. This approach provides more ownership and accountability at the BU level and eliminated a lot of back and forth communications that existed in the past between corporate and the BUs.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe initial implementation was completed in six months, with three months of additional parallel testing before going live in September of 2017. Deploying via the OneStream XF Cloud eliminated the need for internal infrastructure, and minimized the amount of IT time required to set-up and support the system. Finance is now more autonomous, since maintenance and upgrades are easy.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"shortening-the-close-improving-visibility\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eShortening the Close, Improving Visibility\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003e“The OneStream solution has given us the capability to wrap up the monthly close process by day five, which is at least a 25% improvement,” said Brian Ketcham, VP and CFO at Lindsay. “This has enabled faster management reporting, and more agile decision-making.

Management reporting has improved, giving the Finance team more time for analysis, and the capability to drill down to greater detail when analyzing results across BUs.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"streamlining-budgeting-and-forecasting\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eStreamlining Budgeting and Forecasting\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eLindsay also uses OneStream’s unified platform, and the same application as actuals, to support annual budgeting and monthly forecasting. Actuals live together with Budget and Forecast scenarios for instant variance analysis and a cleaner process. “Thanks to the unified approach, we are also saving at least two days per month on forecasting” says Ketcham. “That’s just another way we are extending the value of our OneStream investment.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"extending-dimensions-and-the-platform-for-more-value\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eExtending Dimensions and the Platform for More Value\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eLindsay uses OneStream’s Extensible Dimensionality® to capture more operationally relevant reporting detail – including results by region, product line, and customer segment – providing improved visibility into sales and operating margins across various lines of business. By keeping corporate standards and operationally relevant details in a single application, Lindsay has more agility to adapt to business changes quickly and easily.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the next phase of the implementation, Lindsay is planning to deploy the Account Reconciliations solution from the OneStream XF MarketPlace at corporate as well as the BU level.
